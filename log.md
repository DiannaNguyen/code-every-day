## Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress:** React Native - Understanding the components of React Native, YouTube Follow Along

**Thoughts** So far so good, I feel like as a young person I do everything mostly from my phone so to be able to create apps designed for mobile use is fantastic. Also really cool that it's like on my phone :)

## Day 4: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress:** DJANGO & more React Native

**Thoughts** Switching my mind from React Native to Django tested me a little, but we're doing and it's all good. Was a little discouraged concerning my Hack Week Project (learning and creating an application through React Native). I feel really behind (haven't started code just reading documentation and videos about React Native) - not mental okay atm - but I believe I will make it through and create an application (even if it might not look so good => functionality is key).

## Day 6: April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Wow... so React Native

**Thoughts** React Native is amazing, but the ups and downs of my emotional cycle of change this week has been drastic. I was definitely riding the line of the valley of despair - but at a bright 4/5AM, I hit euphoria and things started to click for me. So maybe I haven't been too scorned by React Native.

## Day 7: April 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** CodeWars - 8 kyu Kata

**Thoughts** I definitely needed a little brain break from React Native - felt good to revert back a little and simply problems solve in vanilla javascript

## Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React Native - Understanding the components of React Native, YouTube Follow Along

**Thoughts** So far so good, I feel like as a young person I do everything mostly from my phone so to be able to create apps designed for mobile use is fantastic. Also really cool that it's like on my phone :)

## Day 4: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: DJANGO & more React Native

**Thoughts** Switching my mind from React Native to Django tested me a little, but we're doing and it's all good. Was a little discouraged concerning my Hack Week Project (learning and creating an application through React Native). I feel really behind (haven't started code just reading documentation and videos about React Native) - not mental okay atm - but I believe I will make it through and create an application (even if it might not look so good => functionality is key)
